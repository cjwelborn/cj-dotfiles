# These are relative executable names and git repo urls.
# After cloning to ~/clones, the executable will be symlinked to
# ~/.local/bin by fresh-install.sh.

# The format is: relative-executable-path-in-repo=repo-url
# If the relative executable ends with .py or .sh, the extension will be
# removed on the symlink.
